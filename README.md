## Spare Change

This is a submission for Ludum Dare 45. The theme was “Start with nothing”. In this short game, you play as a business person who decided to stop by the local casino one day after work. Unfortunately, that one day led to a powerful addiction and over the course of a week, you lost everything. Your home, your job, your friends, etc. Your goal is to make enough money to go to rehab so that you can overcome your addiction and start rebuilding your life.  NOTE: This is the unchanged Ludum Dare 45 submission version. I am currently working on a major update (more of a remake) of the game.
